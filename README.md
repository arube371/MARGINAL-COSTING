# MARGINAL-COSTING
Marginal Costing and Break-Even Analysis (BIA 7202) 
Marginal Costing
Marginal costing is a technique where only variable manufacturing costs are considered for determining the cost of goods sold and inventory valuation.  Fixed costs are treated as period costs and written off against the total contribution. 
Key Features:
•	Costs are divided into fixed, variable, and semi-variable. 
•	Only variable costs are used for stock valuation. 
•	Fixed costs are charged to revenue during the period incurred. 
•	Prices may be based on marginal costs but should ideally cover total costs. 
•	Helps determine profitability using marginal contribution. 
•	Unit cost refers to average variable manufacturing cost. 
Advantages: 
•	Simple to understand.
•	Avoids varying fixed overhead charges per unit. 
•	Prevents illogical carry-forward of fixed overheads in stock valuation. 
•	Facilitates decision-making for sales/production policies. 
•	Enhances cost control and short-term profit planning. 
•	Useful for comparing profitability between products/divisions. 
Limitations: 
•	Difficult to separate costs into fixed and variable accurately. 
•	Fixed costs are excluded from inventory valuation, leading to understated profits. 
•	Unrealistic assumptions about cost behavior and sales price consistency. 
•	Less effective for long-term profit planning compared to absorption costing. 
Absorption Costing
Absorption costing includes all manufacturing costs (direct materials, labor, variable, and fixed overheads) in the cost of goods produced.  It is required for external financial reporting and income tax purposes. 
Key Features:
•	Fixed overheads are absorbed into product costs and charged when goods are sold. 
•	Provides a full-cost view of products/services. 
Difference Between Marginal and Absorption Costing 
1.	Fixed Costs: Absorption costing includes fixed costs in product cost; marginal costing treats them as period costs. 
2.	Profit Calculation: Absorption costing calculates profit as sales minus cost of goods sold; marginal costing uses contribution minus fixed costs. 
3.	Cost Classification: Absorption costing does not classify costs into fixed/variable; marginal costing does. 
4.	Inventory Valuation: Absorption costing values inventory higher due to inclusion of fixed costs; marginal costing excludes fixed costs. 
5.	Overhead Recovery: Absorption costing may lead to under/over-recovery of fixed costs; marginal costing avoids this issue. 
Cost-Volume-Profit (CVP) Analysis 
CVP analysis studies how profits change with variations in output, production costs, and selling prices.  It answers questions like:
•	Sales level to minimize losses or achieve target profit. 
•	Effects of sales mix, price changes, and cost variations on profits. 
Importance:
•	Helps set selling prices. 
•	Assists in product mix selection. 
•	Evaluates special orders. 
•	Analyzes cost changes. 
•	Determines profitability and cash requirements. 
•	Highlights the importance of capacity utilization. 
Objectives:
•	Forecast profits based on cost-volume relationships. 
•	Set flexible budgets for different activity levels. 
•	Evaluate performance and control costs. 
•	Formulate pricing policies. 
Approaches: 
1.	Break-even Chart: Graphical representation of costs, revenue, and activity levels. 
2.	Algebraic Method: Uses formulas to calculate break-even point, target profit, and margin of safety. 
Applications of Marginal Costing 
1.	Fixing Selling Prices: Helps set prices during normal or depressed market conditions. 
2.	Make or Buy Decisions: Assists in deciding whether to manufacture or outsource components. 
3.	Product Mix Selection: Determines the best mix to maximize profits. 
4.	Production Methods: Guides in choosing between alternative production methods. 
5.	Profit Planning: Helps identify optimal output levels for maximum profit. 
6.	Business Closure Decisions: Assesses whether to temporarily or permanently close operations. 
Limitations of Marginal Costing 
•	Difficulty in cost classification. 
•	Unrealistic assumptions about cost and price behavior. 
•	Exclusion of fixed costs from inventory valuation affects profit transparency. 
•	Less useful for long-term profitability analysis. 
•	Does not provide standards for performance evaluation. 
•	Assumes selling price remains constant, which may not be realistic. 
Note: Marginal costing is useful for short-term decision-making, while absorption costing is better for long-term profit planning and external reporting.
